Note that \verb|closed_orbit| and \verb|correct| command may report orbit convergence problems 
when using \verb|EVKICK| in place of \verb|VKICK|. This may be resolved by increasing the
\verb|closed_orbit_accuracy| parameter.

If requested, synchrotron radiation effects are imposed as a kick at the end of the element.
