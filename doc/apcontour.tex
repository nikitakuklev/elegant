The \verb|STICKY| parameter results in the aperture contour being applied inside subsequent \verb|CCBEND|,
\verb|CSBEND|, \verb|CSRCSBEND|, \verb|KQUAD|, \verb|KSEXT|, \verb|KOCT|, and \verb|KQUSE| elements, as well as at the
end of other downstream elements. This continues until another \verb|APCONTOUR| element asserts a new contour, or uses
\verb|CANCEL=1| to cancel the feature.
