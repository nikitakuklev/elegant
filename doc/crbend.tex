This element provides a symplectic {\em rectangular} bending magnet with the exact
Hamiltonian.  The magnet not only has rectangular ends, but the
quadrupole, sextupole, and other multipole terms are defined in Cartesian coordinates.
This is quite different from \verb|CSBEND|, where the edge angles are user-defined and
where the field expansion is in curvilinear coordinates.
Strictly speaking, \verb|CSBEND| is only valid when the dipole is built with curved,
beam-following poles.

Integration of particles in \verb|CRBEND| is very similar to what's done for
\verb|KQUAD|, \verb|KSEXT|, and \verb|KOCT|. 
The only real difference is that coordinate transformations are performed at the
entrance and exit to orient the incoming central trajectory to the straight magnet axis.
In addition, the fractional strength error is adjusted to ensure that the 
outgoing central trajectory is correct.

{\bf Edge angles and edge effects} 

The edge angle treatment in \verb|CRBEND| is very simple, consisting of a 
vertical focusing effect with momentum dependence to all orders.
The user may also specify edge multipoles using the \verb|EDGE_MULTIPOLE| parameter.

{\bf Multipole errors}

Multipole errors are specified for the body and edge in the same fashion as for the
\verb|KQUAD| element.
The reference is the dipole field by default, but this may be changed using the
\verb|REFERENCE_ORDER| parameter.

{\bf Radiation effects}

Incoherent synchrotron radiation, when requested with {\tt ISR=1},
normally uses gaussian distributions for the excitation of the electrons.
Setting {\tt USE\_RAD\_DIST=1} invokes a more sophisticated algorithm that
uses correct statistics for the photon energy and number distributions.
In addition, if {\tt USE\_RAD\_DIST=1} one may also set {\tt ADD\_OPENING\_ANGLE=1},
which includes the photon angular distribution when computing the effect on 
the emitting electron.  

{\bf Adding errors}

When adding errors, care should be taken to choose the right
parameters.  The \verb|FSE| and \verb|ETILT| parameters are used for
assigning errors to the strength and alignment relative to the ideal
values given by \verb|ANGLE| and \verb|TILT|.  One can also assign 
errors to \verb|ANGLE| and \verb|TILT|, but this has a different meaning:
in this case, one is assigning errors to the survey itself.  The reference
beam path changes, so there is no orbit/trajectory error. The most common
thing is to assign errors to \verb|FSE| and \verb|ETILT|.  Note that when
adding errors to \verb|FSE|, the error is assumed to come from the power
supply, which means that multipole strengths also change.

{\bf Splitting dipoles}

The \verb|CRBEND| element does not support splitting.
