Example of using skew quadrupoles driven at the coupling harmonic to
increase the vertical emittance without increasing the vertical 
dispersion too much.

        Basic run for aps zero-dispersion lattice (40-fold symmetry)
        For purposes of illustration, added 80 skew quadrupoles, half in
        the straight sections and half in the dispersion region.

Exciting the dispersive skew quadrupoles with a sinusoidal variation vs position gives a large vertical beamsize (s4),
but also excites the vertical dispersion (s36=etay*Sdelta^2). We are adding both x-y coupling and vertical dispersion.

Exciting the non-dispersive skew quadrupoles with a sinusoidal variation vs position gives a significant
vertical beamsize with very modest excitation of vertical dispersion. Thus, we are adding x-y coupling primarily.

Exciting the dispersive skews with a uniform pattern does not increase the vertical emittance much and 
gives intermediate vertical dispersion.
