Example of performing FMA for (x, delta) where the initial x coordinates
are offset by the closed orbit.

parTrack.lte
        Lattice file. 
        The lattice needs three beamlines, as described at the end.

orbit.ele
        Computes the off-momentum closed orbits

genbeam.ele
        Generates a beam on a grid

prepBeam
        Runs orbit calculation and beam generation

track.ele
        Used to track the particles after beam is prepared.
        mpiexec -np `nproc` Pelegant track.ele

processTracking
        Postprocesses tracking results to give FMA.

cleanUp
        Cleans up output files.
