twissCalculation
        Very basic run to compute Twiss parameters.     

tuneOptimization
        Alters the tune and matches the chromaticity

emittanceOptimization
        Optimization run to reduce the emittance.

tracking
        Tracks particles to look at phase space in (x, x') and (y, y').

chromTracking
        tracks off-momentum particles to determine the chromaticity,
        and compares to twiss parameter computation

frequencyMap
        Tracks particles to make a frequency map

dynamicAperture
        dynamic aperture vs energy offset

momentumAperture
        s-dependent momentum aperture

ejectionOptimization
        Optimizes a three-kicker, two-turn ejection system

bunchLengthening
        Simulates a passive bunch lengthening cavity.

offMomentumDA
        Simulates dynamic aperture at various momentum offsets.

synchrotronTune
        Example of using tracking to determine the synchtron tune

gasScatteringLifetime
gasScatteringLifetimePresFile
        Examples of using scripts to compute gas scattering lifetime from
        DA and LMA data.
