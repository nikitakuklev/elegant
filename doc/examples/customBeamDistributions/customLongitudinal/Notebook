Example of making customized longitudinal distributions.
M. Borland, 2023


deltaDist.sdds
        File giving the desired distribution for fractional momentum offset.
        Note that the PDF is not normalized, which is ok.
timeDist.sdds
        File giving the desired distribution for time.
        Note that the PDF is not normalized, which is ok.

lattice.lte
run1.ele
        These are used to make a beam with the desired (gaussian) transverse
        distributions. At the same time, (t, p) coordinates are generated, but
        those will be replaced

makeCustomDist
        Script to run everything.

cleanUp
        Script to clean up for a fresh try.
