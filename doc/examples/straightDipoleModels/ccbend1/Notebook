Example of using a generalized gradient expansion to create a symplectic model of
a transverse gradient dipole with soft fringe effects using CCBEND.

M. Borland, 2022.

* Files to make the generalized gradient expansion
makeGGE
        Script to do the GGE
Q5-cylinderFields.sdds
        Fields for APS-U Q5 magnet on a cylinder.

* Files to optimize the GGE-based model to ensure the right bending angle.
  Also computes the transport matrix for later comparison

ggeOptMatrix.ele

* Files to run all of the above, then prepare data for CCBEND that include the fringe model
