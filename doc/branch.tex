This element is experimental and should be used with care.
It may not work well with other features, particularly things like Twiss parameter or orbit calculations.
It should work well with tracking.

The application that inspired creation of this element is to switch from tracking using lumped elements to tracking
using element-by-element methods.
More specifically, imagine we want to track for 10,000 turns to reach an equilibrium, then perform a beam dump.
The equilibrium state can be accurately modeled using lumped elements, such as \verb|ILMATRIX| and \verb|SREFFECTS|,
but the beam dump needs to be modeled using element-by-element tracking.
