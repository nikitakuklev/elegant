This element is used together with the {\tt TFBPICKUP} element to
simulate a digital turn-by-turn feedback system.  Each {\tt TFBDRIVER}
element must have a unique identification string assigned to it using
the {\tt ID} parameter.  The same identifier must be used on a {\tt
TFBPICKUP} element.  This is the pickup from which the driver gets its
signal.  Each pickup may feed more than one driver, but a driver can
use only one pickup.

A 30-term FIR filter can be defined using the {\tt A0} through {\tt
A29} parameters.  The output of the filter is simply $\sum_{i=0}^{29}
a_i P_i$, where $P_i$ is the pickup filter output from $i*U$ turns ago,
where $U$ is the \verb|UPDATE_INTERVAL| value specified for the pickup.
The output of the filter is optionally delayed by the number of update intervals
given by the {\tt DELAY} parameter.

To some extent, the {\tt DELAY} is redundant.  For example, the filter
$a_0=0, a_1=1$ with a delay of 0 is equivalent to $a_0=1, a_1=0$ with
a delay of 1.  However, for long delays or delays combined with
many-term filters, the {\tt DELAY} feature must be used.

The output of the filter is multiplied by the {\tt STRENGTH} parameter
to get the kick to apply to the beam.  The {\tt KICK\_LIMIT} parameter
provides a very basic way to simulate saturation of the kicker output.

The plane that the \verb|TFBDRIVER| kicks is determined by the 
\verb|PLANE| parameter on the corresponding \verb|TFBPICKUP| element, and
additionally by the \verb|LONGITUDINAL| parameter, as described in 
Table \ref{tab:tfbdriver}

\begin{table}[htb]
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\hline
\verb|TFBPICKUP| & \verb|TFBDRIVER| & coordinate & note \\
\verb|PLANE| & \verb|LONGITUDINAL| & kicked & \\
\hline
x & 0 & $x^\prime$ & \\
x & 1 & $\delta$ & pickup should have $\eta_x\neq 0$ \\
y & 0 & $y\prime$ & \\
y & 1 & $\delta$ & pickup should have $\eta_y\neq 0$ \\
delta & 0 & - & invalid \\
delta & 1 & $\delta$ & \\

Note: The \verb|OUTPUT_FILE| will produce a file with missing data at the end of
the buffer if the \verb|OUTPUT_INTERVAL| parameter is not a divisor of the number of passes.

See Section 7.2.14 of {\em Handbook of Accelerator Physics and Engineering}
