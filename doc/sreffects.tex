This element allows simulation of synchrotron radiation effects in a
lumped fashion for quick, approximate results.  There are two ways to
set up the element: explicit initialization or automatic
initialization.  

In explicit initialization, the user supplies the quantities {\tt
EXREF}, {\tt EYREF}, {\tt SDELTAREF}, {\tt DDELTAPREF}, and {\tt
PREF}.  These are, respectively, the reference values for the x-plane
emittance, y-plane emittance, fractional momentum spread, energy loss
per turn, and momentum.  The first four values pertain to the
reference momentum.  {\tt JX}, {\tt JY}, and {\tt JDELTA} may also
be given, although the defaults work for typical lattices.

In automatic initialization, the user turns on the radiation integral
feature in {\tt twiss\_output}, causing {\tt elegant} to automatically
compute the above quantities.  The {\tt COUPLING} parameter can be used
to change the partitioning of quantum excitation between the horizontal
and vertical planes.
