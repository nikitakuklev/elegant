radiation,'' Phys. Rev. ST Accel. Beams 4, 070701 (2001).

{\bf Recommendations for using this element.}  The default values for
this element are not the best ones to use.  They are retained only for
consistency through upgrades.  In using this element, it is
recommended to have 50 to 100 k particle in the simulation.  Setting
{\tt BINS=600} and {\tt SG\_HALFWIDTH=1} is also recommended to allow
resolution of fine structure in the beam and to avoid excessive
smoothing.  It is strongly suggested that the user vary these
parameters and view the histogram output to verify that the
longitudinal distribution is well represented by the histograms (use
{\tt OUTPUT\_FILE} to obtain the histograms).  For LCLS simulations,
we find that the above parameters give essentially the same results as
obtained with 500 k particles and up to 3000 bins.

In order to verify that the 1D approximation is valid, the user should
also set {\tt DERBENEV\_CRITERION\_MODE = ``evaluate''} and view
the data in {\tt OUTPUT\_FILE}.  Generally, the criterion should be
much less than 1.
