If \verb|STORE_TURN_BY_TURN| is nonzero, then the computed BPM readings are stored in
{\em ElementName}\#{\em ElementOccurence}.x and {\em ElementName}\#{\em ElementOccurence}.y 
during tracking.
These can be used in the \verb|expression| in \verb|modulate|elements| to create position-triggered
changes to elements.
