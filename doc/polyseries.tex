This element allows transforming the beam using an arbitrary polynomial in the six phase space coordinates,
$x$, $q_x$, $y$, $q_y$, $s$, and $\delta$.
Please note that the canonical momenta are used here, not the slopes.

The input file is required to have six pages, each of which gives the polynomial for a different output coordinate.
The file has the following elements:
\begin{itemize}
\item String parameter \verb|Coordinate| names the output coordinate. The file must contain a page
      for each coordinate, using the names \verb|x|, \verb|qx|, \verb|y|, \verb|qy|, \verb|s|,
      and \verb|delta|.
\item Integer columns \verb|Ix|, \verb|Iqx|, \verb|Iy|, \verb|Iqy|, \verb|Is|, and \verb|Idelta|, which
      give the exponent to be used for the indicated coordinates.
\item Floating-point column \verb|Coefficient| giving the coefficient by which to multiply the 
      product of powers of the coordinates.
             I.e., the term is $C x^{\rm Ix} q_x^{\rm Iqx} y^{\rm Iy} q_y^{\rm Iqy}  s^{\rm Is} \delta^{\rm Idelta}$
\end{itemize}

Note that in the present version, dependence on $s$ is actually ignored.
