This element is used for simulation of intra-beam scattering
(IBS). The IBS algorithm is based on the Bjorken and
Mtingwa's~\cite{BM} formula, and with an extension of including
vertical dispersion. It can be used for both storage ring and Linac.

To initialize IBS calculation, one or more IBSCATTER elements must be
inserted into the beamline. {\tt elegant} calculates the integrated
IBS growth rates between IBSCATTERs (or from beginning of the beamline
to first IBSCATTER), then scats particles at each IBSCATTER
element. Beam's parameters are updated for use in downstream elements.

Because the IBS growth rates are energy dependent, special caution is
needed for calculations with accelerating beam. The user needs to
split their accelerating cavity into several pieces, so that $\gamma$
has no large changes between elements.

The user can examine the calculation through an optional SDDS output
file - {\it filename}. The file has a multiple page structure. One
IBSCATTER element at pass $i$ occupies one page. Each page contains
integrated IBS growth rates between IBSCATTERs (or from beginning of
the beamline to first IBSCATTER) as parameters, and local rates for
elements in between as tabular data.
