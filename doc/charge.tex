This is the preferred way to assign charge to a beam, which is needed for the use of CSR simulation (CSRCSBEND, CSRDRIFT),
wake simulation (WAKE, TRWAKE, LRWAKE, ZLONGIT, ZTRANSVERSE), rf mode simulation (RFMODE, TRFMODE, FRFMODE, RTRFMODE),
space charge simulation (LSCDRIFT, RFCW, SCMULT), and intrabeam scattering simulation (IBSCATTER).
