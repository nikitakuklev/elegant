This element provides simulation of undulators using kick maps \cite{Elleaume1992}.
A script (\verb|km2sdds|) is provided with the {\tt elegant}
distribution to translate RADIA \cite{radia} output into SDDS for use by
\verb|elegant|.

The input file has the following columns:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|x| --- Horizontal position in meters.
\item \verb|y| --- Vertical position in meters.
\item \verb|xpFactor| --- Horizontal kick factor in $T^2 m^2$.
\item \verb|ypFactor| --- Vertical kick factor in $T^2 m^2$.
\end{itemize}
The values of \verb|x| and \verb|y| must be laid out on a grid of equispaced points.
It is assumed that the data is ordered such that \verb|x| varies fastest.  This can be
accomplished with the command
\begin{verbatim}
% sddssort -column=y,increasing -column=x,increasing input1.sdds input2.sdds
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|input1.sdds| is the original (unordered) file and \verb|input2.sdds| is the
new file, which would be used with \verb|UKICKMAP|.

This was requested by W. Guo (BNL), who also assisted with the
implementation and debugging.
