This element provides a symplectic bending magnet that is accurate to
all orders in momentum offset.  The field expansion is available to
fourth order.

One pitfall of symplectic integration is the possibility of orbit and
path-length errors for the reference orbit if too few kicks are used.
This may be an issue for rings.  Hence, one must verify that a
sufficient number of kicks are being used by looking at the trajectory
closure and length of an on-axis particle by tracking.  Using 
{\tt INTEGRATION\_ORDER=4} is recommended to reduce the number of
required kicks.

Normally, one specifies the higher-order components of the field with
the {\tt K1}, {\tt K2}, {\tt K3}, and {\tt K4} parameters. The field
expansion in the midplane is $B_y(x) = B_o * (1 +
\sum_{n=1}^4\frac{K_n\rho_o}{n!}x^n)$.  By setting the {\tt USE\_bN}
flag to a nonzero value, one may instead specify the {\tt b1} through
{\tt b4} parameters, which are defined by the expansion $B_y(x) = B_o
* (1 + \sum_{n=1}^4\frac{b_n}{n!}x^n)$.  This is convenient if one is
varying the dipole radius but wants to work in terms of constant field
quality.  

Setting {\tt NONLINEAR=0} turns off all the terms above {\tt K_1} (or {\tt b_1}) and
also turns off higher-order effects due to curvature that would
normally result in a gradient producing terms of higher order.

Edge effects are included using a first- or second-order matrix.  The
order is controlled using the {\tt EDGE\_ORDER} parameter, which has a
default value of 1.  N.B.: if you choose the second-order matrix, it
is not symplectic.
