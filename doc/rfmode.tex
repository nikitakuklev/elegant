This element simulates a beam-driven monopole mode cavity using the fundamental theorem of beam loading and phasor rotation.

Normally, the field dumped in the cavity by one particle affects trailing particles in the same turn.
However, if one is also using a \verb|WAKE| or \verb|ZLONGIT| element to simulate the short-range wake of the cavity, this would be double-counting.
In that case, one can use \verb|LONG_RANGE_ONLY=1| to suppress the same-turn effects of the \verb|RFMODE| element.
