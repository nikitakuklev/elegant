This element simulates a wiggler or undulator.  There are two aspects
to the simulation: the effect on radiation integrals and the vertical
focusing.  Both are included as of release 15.2 of elegant.  Also, we
include the half-strength end poles, but only on the radiation
integrals.  These half-poles ensure that the dispersion contribution
of the wiggler matches back to zero at the end of the device.

The radiation integrals are computed by summing the contributions for
a series of half-poles.  The integrals for a single half-pole were
computed analytically using Mathematica, using a sinusoidal field
variation.  The horizontal beta function and dispersion are propogated
correctly for these computations.  Of course, the beta function
propagates as in a drift space.

The vertical focusing is implemented as a distributed quadrupole-like
term (affecting ony the vertical, unlike a true quadrupole).  The
strength of the quadrupole is (see Wiedemann, {\em Particle Accelerator
Physics II}, section 2.3.2)
\begin{equation}
K_1 = \frac{1}{2\rho^2},
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the bending radius at the center of a pole.  The
undulator is focusing in the vertical plane.
