There are three modes for implementing alignment errors. Which is used
is controlled by the value of the \verb|MALIGN_METHOD| parameter:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|MALIGN_METHOD=0| --- This selects the original method, which was
  the only one available before version 2021.1. The misalignment is
  referenced to the entrance face. The \verb|YAW| and \verb|PITCH| parameters
  are ignored.
\item \verb|MALIGN_METHOD=1| --- This selects a method based on M. Venturini's
  work \cite{Venturini2021}, with misalignment referenced to the entrance face.
  The \verb|YAW| and \verb|PITCH| parameters are implemented.
  This is incompatible with the \verb|moments_output| command at present.
\item \verb|MALIGN_METHOD=2| --- This selects a method based on M. Venturini's
  work \cite{Venturini2021}, with misalignment referenced to the magnet center.
  The \verb|YAW| and \verb|PITCH| parameters are implemented.
  This is incompatible with the \verb|moments_output| command at present.
\end{itemize}
