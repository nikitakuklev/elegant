The input file for this element gives the transverse-wake Green
functions, $W_x(t)$ and $W_y(t)$, versus time behind the particle. The
units of the wakes are V/C/m, so this element simulates the integrated
wake of some structure (e.g., a cell or series of cells).  If you
have, for example, the wake for a cell and you need the wake for N
cells, then you may use the {\tt FACTOR} parameter to make the
appropriate multiplication.  The values of the time coordinate should
begin at 0 and be equi-spaced.  A positive value of time represents
the distance behind the exciting particle.  

The sign convention for $W_q$ ($q$ being $x$ or $y$) is as follows: a
particle with $q>0$ will impart a positive kick ($\Delta q^\prime >
0$) to a trailing particle following $t$ seconds behind if $W_q(t)>0$.
A physical wake function should be zero at $t=0$ and also be initially
positive as $t$ increases from 0.

Use of the {\tt CHARGE} parameter on the {\tt TRWAKE} element is
disparaged.  It is preferred to use the {\tt CHARGE} element as part
of your beamline to define the charge.  

Setting the {\tt N\_BINS} paramater to 0 is recommended.  This results
in auto-scaling of the number of bins to accomodate the beam.  The bin
size is fixed by the spacing of the time points in the wake.

The default degree of smoothing ({\tt SG\_HALFWIDTH=4}) may be excessive.
It is suggested that users vary this parameter to verify that results
are reliable if smoothing is employed ({\tt SMOOTHING=1}).
