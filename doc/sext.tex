This element simulates a sextupole using a matrix, up to third order.

The \verb|K1| and \verb|J1| parameters allow introducing normal and skew quadrupole {\bf error} terms.
The matrix expressions assume that
these are weak effects and high accuracy should not be expected if this is not true.
If \verb|K1| is significant, then use of the \verb|KQUSE| element is preferred.
