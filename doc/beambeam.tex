This element provides a simple model of beam-beam kicks from a stiff opposing beam
defined by the bunch charge, transverse centroids, and transverse sizes.

Three distribution types are supported:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|gaussian| --- A transversely-gausssian charge distribution is used.
  The parameters \verb|XSIZE| and \verb|YSIZE| are interpreted as
  the rms sizes of the distribution. 
The computations are based on the Bassetti-Erskine formula \cite{BassettiErskine}.
\item \verb|uniform| --- A uniformly-filled two-dimensional ellipsoidal distribution is used.
\begin{equation}
  \rho(x,y, z) = \frac{Q}{\pi a b L}
\end{equation}
 when
$(x/a)^2 + (y/b)^2\leq 1$ and $\left|z\right|\leq L/2$, and zero otherwise.
The parameters \verb|XSIZE| and \verb|YSIZE| are interpreted as $a$ and $b$, respectively.
$L$ is the length of the slug of charge, which is assumed to be sufficiently short that
the impulse approximation is valid.
The computations are based on Furman's expressions \cite{Furman-LBL-34682}.
\item \verb|parabolic| --- A parabolic two-dimensional ellipsoidal distribution is used.
\begin{equation}
  \rho(x,y,z) = \frac{2 Q}{\pi a b L} (1 - (x/a)^2 - (y/b)^2)
\end{equation}
 when
$(x/a)^2 + (y/b)^2\leq 1$ and $\left|z\right|\leq L/2$, and zero otherwise.
The parameters \verb|XSIZE| and \verb|YSIZE| are interpreted as $a$ and $b$, respectively.
$L$ is the length of the slug of charge, which is assumed to be sufficiently short that
the impulse approximation is valid.
The computations are based on Furman's expressions \cite{Furman-LBL-34682}.
