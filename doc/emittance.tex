This element allows changing the  emittance of a beam during tracking.
It  is intended to  be used  to modify  the emittance  ``slightly'' to
agree  with,  for   example,  experimental  measurements.   A  typical
application  might  use  an  EMITTANCE  element and  a  TWISS  element
together to transform the beam to exactly match measurements.
