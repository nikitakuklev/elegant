This element is a combination of the {\tt RFCA}, {\tt WAKE}, and {\tt
TRWAKE} elements.  As such, it provides combined simulation of an rf
cavity with longitudinal and transverse wakes.

For the wakes, the input files and their interpretation are identical
to {\tt WAKE} and {\tt TRWAKE}, except that the transverse and
longitudinal wakes are interpreted as the wakes for a single cell of
length given by the {\tt CELL\_LENGTH} parameter.

Users should read the entries for {\tt WAKE}, {\tt TRWAKE}, and {\tt RFCA}
for more details on this element.
