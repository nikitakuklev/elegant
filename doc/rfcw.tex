This element is a combination of the {\tt RFCA}, {\tt WAKE}, and {\tt
TRWAKE} elements.  As such, it provides combined simulation of an rf
cavity with longitudinal and transverse wakes, as well as longitudinal
space charge.

For the wakes, the input files and their interpretation are identical
to {\tt WAKE} and {\tt TRWAKE}, except that the transverse and
longitudinal wakes are interpreted as the wakes for a single cell of
length given by the {\tt CELL\_LENGTH} parameter.

Users should read the entries for {\tt WAKE}, {\tt TRWAKE}, and {\tt RFCA}
for more details on this element.

This element simulates longitudinal space charge using the
method described in \cite{Huang2004}.  This is based on the 
longitudinal space charge impedance per unit length
\begin{equation}
  Z_{lsc}(k) = \frac{i Z_0}{\pi k r_b^2} \left[ 1 - \frac{kr_b}{\gamma}K_1 \left(\frac{kr_b}{\gamma}\right)\right]
\end{equation}

N.B.: {\em Do not use \verb|CHANGE_T=1| if you have rf cavities that
are not at harmonics of one another or if you have other
time-dependent elements that are not resonant. Also, if you have harmonic
cavities, only use CHANGE_T on the cavity with the lowest frequency.
Failure to follow these rules can result in wrong results and crashes.}
