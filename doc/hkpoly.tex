This element imposes kicks on the beam according
to a Hamiltonian that is a polynomial function of x and y 
\begin{equation}
H\Delta s = \sum_{i=0}^{4} \sum_{j=0}^{4} \sum_{k=0}^4 \sum_{l=0}^4 C_{ijkl} x^i y^j q_x^k q_y^l,
\end{equation}
where $C_{0000} = 0$.
The changes to the momenta and positions are determined via Hamilton's equations.

For example, a quadrupole with integrated strength $K_1 L$  could be specified by setting $C_{2000} = -C_{0200} = K_1 L/2$.
A sextupole with integrated strength $K_2 L$ could be specified by setting $C_{3000} = K_2 L/6$ and $C_{1200} = K_2 L/2$.
The purpose, however, is not to simulate such elements, since they can be more conveniently simulated with 
\verb|KQUAD| or \verb|KSEXT|.
It is rather to simulate elements that may not be described by the usual multipoles.
