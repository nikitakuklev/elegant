The input file must be an SDDS file and must have one page for each value of the radius.
Each page must be sorted in increasing order by the z coordinate.
The \verb|z| and \verb|r| data must be in meters, while the \verb|Bz| and \verb|Br| data must
be in Tesla.

Starting with a single-page file containing $(z, r, Bz, Br)$, one can easily produce the
required file using this command sequence
\begin{verbatim}
sddssort solenoid.sdds -pipe=out -column=r -column=z \
 | sddsbreak -pipe=in mapSolenoid.sdds -change=r
\end{verbatim}

The preferred integrator is non-adaptive Runge-Kutta, since the adaptive integrators tend
to have convergence problems.

N.B.: for historical reasons, the default value of the \verb|FACTOR| parameter is set to \verb|0.0001|, which is
apt to introduce confusion.
